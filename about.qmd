## About this blog

A data analysis master student with finance undergraduate background. 

The Garden of Gains is a quiet space where I gather my thoughts and observations about the world of math and finance. Like keeping a journal in a garden, I write to reflect on the news I read, the case studies I explore, and the insights I uncover along the way. This is where ideas take root, grow, and sometimes bloom into deeper understanding. Itâ€™s not just about gains in numbers, but growth in thought.
