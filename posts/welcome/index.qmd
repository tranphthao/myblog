Exponential models are among the most fundamental tools in mathematical modeling. Although real-world phenomena are often too complex to be captured by exponential models alone, requiring adjustments and the inclusion of external factors - these models still serve as essential foundations for many modern, sophisticated mathematical frameworks. This journal documents my study of the core principles of exponential models and their notable applications.
